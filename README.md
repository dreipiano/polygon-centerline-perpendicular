# polygon-centerline-perpendicular
This Python script is designed to generate center and perpendicular lines from existing polygon geometries within a GeoDataFrame. 
Using libraries like shapely, numpy, geopandas, and pygeoops, it calculates the lengths of these lines and facilitates the analysis 
of geometric relationships in spatial data. The script first loads a polygon shapefile and creates centerlines from it, then generates 
a series of perpendicular lines at specified intervals. The original and generated lines are saved as shapefiles for easy 
access and further use in GIS applications.
